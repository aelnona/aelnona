Hi, I'm Aaron ;

I study computer science and am very interested in AI and digital forensics. Currently, I am in sixth form, taking A levels for maths, computer science, chemistry, and biology.

I mainly use Alpine Linux, but have experience with Gentoo Linux and Debian-based distributions of Linux, and some small experience with Plan9 (specifically Plan9Front), having experimented with it for a time on a Thinkpad x61 and a Raspberry Pi.

At the moment I am using Java for various tasks, such as completing challenges on Project Euler and in the Southampton National Cipher Challenge (www.cipherchallenge.org). My favourite programming language is Rust, though I am focusing mainly on Java for the moment as it is what we use at school. Also learning Forth (very slowly).

My hobbies include:

- 3D modelling with Blender
- 3D printing on an Ender 3
- Chess (https://lichess.org/@/Edgenheiden)
- Reading books, mostly fiction
- Messing with old hardware (e.g. old Thinkpads)
